The MetaBrainz Foundation
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization"
>501.(c).3 tax-exempt non-profit</a> based in San Luis Obispo, California that
operates the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> project.
</p>

<p>
MusicBrainz is a user maintained community music metadatabase. Music metadata is 
information such as the name of an artist, the name of an album and list of tracks 
that appear on an album. MusicBrainz collects this information about music and makes 
it available to the public.
</p>

<p>
With the creation of the MetaBrainz Foundation, the MusicBrainz project enters 
its second phase of life. In the first incarnation, the project was privately
maintained and focused primarily on basic music metadata described above. Today
the MusicBrainz project has the legal backing and infrstructure of the MetaBrainz
Foundation, which will allow it to embark on a mission to expand it's scope.
</p>

<p>
MusicBrainz recently released the <i>Advanced Relationships</i> feature which
allows volunteers to enter vastly more information about music than previously
possible. The advanced relationships feature allows people to enter a wide
range of information -- from essential music information to obscure
facts about music and the musicians who created it.
With these new features, MusicBrainz takes the first step towards creating
a user contributed music encyclopedia.
