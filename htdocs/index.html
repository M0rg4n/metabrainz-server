<p>
The MetaBrainz Foundation
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization"
>501.(c).3 tax-exempt non-profit</a> based in San Luis Obispo, California that
operates the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> project.
</p>

<p>
MusicBrainz is a user maintained community music metadatabase. Music metadata is 
information such as the name of an artist, the name of an album and list of tracks 
that appear on an album. MusicBrainz collects this information about music and makes 
it available to the public.
</p>

<p>
With the creation of the MetaBrainz Foundation, the MusicBrainz project enters 
its second phase of life. In the first incarnation, the project was privately
maintained and focused primarily on basic music metadata described above. Today
the MusicBrainz project has the legal backing and infrastructure of the MetaBrainz
Foundation, which will allow it to embark on a mission to expand its scope.
</p>

<p>
In 2005 MusicBrainz released the <i>Advanced Relationships</i> feature which
allows volunteers to enter vastly more information about music than previously
possible. This new feature allows MusicBrainz to capture essential music 
information as well as obscure facts about music and the musicians who created it.
With these new features, MusicBrainz takes the first step towards creating
a user contributed music encyclopedia. 
</p>

<p>
MusicBrainz is gaining traction with its business model to provide convenient
and timely access to its music metadata. Recently the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk">British
Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) signed up to be a customer of MusicBrainz' 
 <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/LiveDataFeed">live data feed</a> to include
MusicBrainz metadata in its online offerings. For more information on this new
partnership, please see the <a href="/news/pressrelease/MetaBrainzPressRelease_20070628.html">
press release</a>.
