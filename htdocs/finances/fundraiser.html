<p>
On April 19th, we've started our first fundraiser!
</p>

<p>
We're trying to raise $25,000 in order
to bootstrap the MetaBrainz Foundation and to fund the next six months of operations.
In those six months we will develop new features for MusicBrainz and also work on
selling licenses to our live data-feed. By selling licenses to corporations for commercial
use, we hope to become self sufficient at the end of this year.
</p>

<p>
Please <a href="/donate" style="font-weight: bold;">donate</a> to help us meet our goal! All of your
donations are tax-deductible!
