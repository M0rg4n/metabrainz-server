<h2>MetaBrainz Foundation Inc.</h2>

<p>
The MetaBrainz Foundation
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization"
>501.(c).3 tax-exempt non-profit</a> based in San Luis Obispo, California that
operates the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> project.
The non-profit company was founded
to provide a legal entity for the MusicBrainz project that had
been operating as a private project. Robert Kaye managed MusicBrainz
as a private project from its inception in the fall of 2000 until
the project was turned over to the new company in December 2004.
</p>

<p>
The creation of the non-profit does not change the goals of the MusicBrainz
project in any shape. The project will continue its mission, but now with
a solid legal footing required of a project that is growing and taking
on more donors and customers. All financial information of the MusicBrainz project 
will now be listed on this site on this site.
</p>

<p>
The MetaBrainz Foundation continues the MusicBrainz tradition of 
<a href="/finances">transparent finances</a> and will hopefully 
continue to be cashflow positive as MusicBrainz has managed for
its entire existance before incorporation. Like MusicBrainz, the MetaBrainz
Foundation will continue to <a href="/donate">collect donations</a> from the general
public. The non-profit will also sell licenses of the MusicBrainz 
<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/about/licenses.html">live data-feed
for commercial use</a>, in order to support further development of the MusicBrainz
system.
