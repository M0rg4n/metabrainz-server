<& /comp/sidebar, title => "MetaBrainz Foundation Annual Report 2006" &>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
2006 was the MetaBrainz Foundation's first <i>interesting</i> year of doing business and it is time to take a quantitative
look of the business practices of the foundation. The MetaBrainz Foundation was established in October of 2004 and
it wasn't until 2006 that the foundation has significant income from other sources than its core users to warrant a
closer look at the operations. Even though the Foundation earned a modest $42,312.93 in 2006 (as compared to
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2007/01/the_mozilla_foundation_achievi.html">millions of dollars over at the 
Mozilla Foundation</a>) the trends in its business provide a glance at things to come.
</p>

<p>
In 2006 the Foundation gained quite a bit of traction as it unveiled a batch of new features and <a href="http://muiscip.com">MusicIP</a>
as its new partner in the acoustic fingerprinting business. Traffic to the site continually increased and the database grew at a consistent 
rate throughout 2006, even as a rift in the MusicBrainz community appeared in the summer. Disputes between developers and the community 
caused a fair amount of upheaval that ended up in the dismissal of one of the developers. In the fall business returned to normal
as the community returned its focus on building a world class music encyclopedia and improving features on all levels of the project.
</p>

<p>
The finances of the foundation received a huge boost when <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/07/google_pledges.html">Google 
donated $15,000</a>, which allowed for a small salary for the Executive
Director. New business relationships with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">British Broadcasting Company</a> and the emergence of tagger 
affiliate program in latter
half of 2006 provided validation that the MetaBrainz Foundation is on the right track to becoming a viable open business.
</p>

<h1>MetaBrainz as an open business</h1>

<p>
MusicBrainz and MetaBrainz are deeply committed to the openness of its data, software and finances. In 2006 it became apparent
that MusicBrainz is starting to capitalize on its data and software assets and enables others to capitalize on these open
assets as well. With these accomplishments, it appears that the MetaBrainz Foundation and its supporters are lending credibilty
to its open business model.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://openbusiness.cc">Open Business project</a> defines an open business as:
</p>

<blockquote>
.. entrepreneurial ideas which are built around openness, free services and free access.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Foundation certainly fits the description of an open business, since its <a href="http://metabrainz.org/finances/">finances are open</a>, 
the services free and the access to its data ensured by the Public Domain and <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses.
However, in 2006 it became apparent that not only the MetaBrainz Foundation was beginning to capitalize on these assets, but third parties
working with the Foundation were participating to earn more money than the Foundation itself.
</p>

<p>
In early August the MetaBrainz Foundation entered into its first affilitate agreement with Matthias Kunter, the author of the 
<a href="http://www.magic-tagger.com/">Magic MP3 tagger</a>. In exchange for adding prominent links to his tagger site
to MusicBrainz, Matthias agreed to pay the Foundation &euro;250 a month or 10% of the registration income for this tagger,
whichever amount is greater. Matthias' payment to the Foundation
in December amounted to a respectable &euro;563.29! Covering more than half of our monthly hosting costs, Matthias' payments 
have become our second largest continuous revenue source in 2006. Simple math tells us that Matthias is earning in excess of &euro;5000 a
month, which drastically exceeds the income of the Foundation itself.
</p>

<p>
A successful open business should foster the creation of other businesses to form an active ecosystem of companies that
rely on another to carry out business. Matthias has proven that MusicBrainz is enabling others to create new businesses
that were previously not possible. And now in the beginning of 2007 two more authors have expressed interest in participating
in the tagger affiliate program allowing the Foundation to set the goal to have the day-to-day costs of operating the service
be covered by donations from the community and affiliate income.
</p>


<h1>Year in Review</h1>

<h2>Ramping up and moving to San Luis Obispo</h2>

<p>
At the beginning of 2006 MusicBrainz was running on three severely overloaded servers at the Community Colocation Project (CCCP) in Fremont, CA.
At this point it had become clear that more machines were required in short order and that the CCCP would not be able to provide
the services that a growing project like MusicBrainz required.
</p>

<p>
In January the search for more machines and a new hosting company were started. Progress came very quickly when 
<a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/01/two_dell_powere.html">Minor Ventures</a> donated two Dell servers.
In February the Foundation signed a contract to start hosting its servers in San Luis Obispo at the well renowned
<a href="http://digitalwest.net">Digital West Networks</a>. Renting 10Us of rack space MusicBrainz today has 6 computers in active service
and one spare server to cover hardware failures.
</p>

<h2>SWSX brings about relationship with MusicIP</h2>

<p>
MusicIP, which was still Predixis at the start of 2006, agreed to provide MusicBrainz and its community free acoustic fingerprint 
services as part of their new <a href="http://musicdns.org">MusicDNS service</a>. MusicBrainz in turn integrated the MusicDNS 
services into its upcoming Picard music tagging 
application. In exchange for theses services MusicIP started using MusicBrainz' live data-feed to integrate MusicBrainz data
into the MusicDNS service. MusicIP customers can now choose MusicBrainz metadata as an optional add-on service for MusicDNS with
MusicIP providing MetaBrainz with a 10% revenue share for the add-on service.
</p>

<p>
As part of the agreement MusicIP also sponsored Robert Kaye's time to allow him to work on the soon-to-be open sourced MusicDNS client
as well as developing a number of new features in MusicBrainz. These new features would aide MusicBrainz in providing more
scalable services in anticipation of upcoming growth. During this sponsored development time the new Lucene full text search, a new
XML Web Service and the MusicDNS/PUID services were integrated into MusicBrainz. This new partnership was announced at South
by Southwest (SXSW) music conference in Austin in March.
</p>

<h2>Improved web interface and a great dispute</h2>

<p>
The relatively quiet post SXSW period allowed MusicBrainz to clean up various pieces that had loose ends left over from
the hectic launch at SXSW. During this time Stefan Kestenholz worked on a significant update to the MusicBrainz web site
greatly improving the standards compliance of the site. The overall look and feel of the site was improved and a number
of new features that made life easier for MusicBrainz users were developed by Stefan.
</p>

<p>
In the weeks leading up to the release of the new site MusicBrainz was headed for its first serious
community shake-up. After having become the de-facto server maintainer Stefan was continually involved in
heated discussion between himself and members of the community. The overall communication process between
the developers and the community broke down as tensions continually increased and tempers flared in 
all aspects surrounding MusicBrainz server development.
</p>

<p>
After weeks of discussions on how to fix the broken development process and to resolve community tension, 
Robert Kaye took the unpopular step of <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/08/developer_chang.html">removing 
Stefan as the de-facto server developer</a>. After this event, various members of the MusicBrainz community
got involved and helped out to extract the important lessons from the dispute and how to prevent these situations
from escalating again. (The great dispute covers many aspects of online communities and social interactions that 
go beyond the scope of this annual report. If you'd like to find out more about this dispute, please read our 
<a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/GreatDispute">GreatDispute</a> wiki page).
</p>

<h2>Fall: Getting back to business</h2>

<p>
During the fall of 2006 the MusicBrainz community quieted down and focused on getting back to work. While the server development moves at 
a slower pace today, the community has been relatively conflict free since the late summer. In December one more server update was made to 
roll out a number of bug fixes and to smooth our some problems left over from the turbulent improved look and feel release.
</p>

<p>
In December John Buckman of <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> joined the MetaBrainz board of directors, replacing the
perenially overloaded Joi Ito. Finally the year closed out with Santa Claus delivering a powerful new server from Sun
Microsystems. (see secion <a href="#servers">Servers and hosting</a> for more details on this)
</p>

<h1>Project Statistics</h1>

<p>
Over the course of the year we collected a number of statistics about the project:
</p>

<h2>Database size</h2>

<p>
At the end of 2006 our database stats were:
</p>

<table class="figure">
<tr><td>Artists</td><td align="right">283,856</td></tr>
<tr><td>Releases</td><td align="right">450,136</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tracks</td><td align="right">5,374,216</td></tr>
<tr><td>Links</td><td align="right">371,376</td></tr>
<tr><td>Disc IDs</td><td align="right">179,201</td></tr>
<tr><td>PUIDs</td><td align="right">1,727,905</td></tr>
<tr><td>TRM IDs</td><td align="right">11,597,996</td></tr>
<tr><td>Edits</td><td align="right">4,201,501</td></tr>
<tr><td>Editors</td><td align="right">281,714</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
At the beginning of the year we had no PUIDs and at the SWSX launch we had 800 thousand PUIDs. Nine months later we at more than double that 
at 1.7 million PUIDs -- its clear that the MusicBrainz community
has embraced the MusicDNS PUIDs. We also crossed the threshold of a quarter million registered users and five million tracks cataloged in 
MusicBrainz and a whopping 4 million changes to the database since the project's inception.
</p>

<h2>Traffic</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz served out 614 millon web hits, 283 million RDF web service hits and 69 million XML web service hits. 
Throughout the year the MusicBrainz traffic generally increased with the exception of January when MusicBrainz
was recovering from having the MusicBrainz Classic Tagger be named of of the top audio products of 2005 by Wired Magazine: 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="traffic.png"><img class="figure" src="traffic.png" width="425" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p>
The new XML web service starts picking up traffic much more traffic torwards the end of the year,
and in December MusicBrainz nearly served out as many XML web service hits as RDF web service hits.
This clearly shows that developers who are using MusicBrainz prefer the new XML/REST web service
over the aging RDF web service.
</p>

<p>
In preparing these statistics it has become clear that MusicBrainz needs better usage tracking software to get a more 
detailed insight into its traffic. Webalizer, which calculated the traffic for MusicBrainz in 2006, has a number of
shortcomings including the lack of a good way of representing page views compared to raw hits. Unfortunately MusicBrainz does
not have good page view statistics for 2006. However, in early 2007 MusicBrainz started using Google Analytics for
its future traffic analysis in hopes of presenting more meaningful numbers in the 2007 annual report.
</p>

<h2>Top Editors and Voters</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz depends on its lively community to enter and maintain this vast body of data. 2006 proved once again
that the MusicBrainz community consists of an amazing collection of people. Mudcrow, our top editor and voter (peer reviewer) of 2006
made an astounding 100,998 changes to the database and voted on 38,347 edits from other editors! Thank you for all of your
efforts mudcrow!

<h2>New users</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz accepted new users at a fairly consistent rate over 2006, usually ranging between 7,000 and 9,000 new users per month:
</p>

<p>
    <a href="newusers.png"><img class="figure" src="newusers.png" width="375" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p>
Since MusicBrainz is heavily dependent on its user community it is also important that the community not grow too fast. 
A growth rate of 10,000 new users per month seems to work fairly well.
</p>

<a name="servers">
<h2>Servers and hosting</h2>
</a>

<p>
Over the course of the year, MusicBrainz grew from three machines, to a current complement of twelve machines. The cast of
characters that served out over 600 million web hits includes:
</p>

<ol>
<li>stimpy - the primary web server</li>
<li>dexter - the primary database server</li>
<li>blik - the search server</li>
<li>scooby - the catch all services server: bug tracking, forums, mailing list, etc</li>
<li>catbus - a replicated database slave handling web service database queries
<li>lingling - a cold spare machine for hardware failures of other boxes</li>
<li>bender - our TRM acoustic fingerprint server</li>
<li>hefty - soon to be the UK mirror of MusicBrainz</li>
<li>zim - semi-retired test and development machine</li>
</ol>

<p>
To bring our count up to twelve servers, <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/12/sun_microsystem.html">Sun Microsystems donated
a powerful database server</a> and an anonymous donor donated two 1U, dual processor servers. All of these machines are still unnamed
and waiting to be rotated into service.
The Foundation is proud to be on first name basis with the machines that do all the work and fosters the ethical treatment
of computers; the Foundation refuses to apply cold numbers as names of its machines!
</p>

<h1>Project finances</h1>

<h2>Profit and Loss</h2>

<p>
For 2006 and we took in $41,312.93 and spent $34,973.98, for a total <i>profit</i> of $6,338.95. (non-profits can still earn a profit, but that profit
must be reinvested into the company, not paid out to is officers/directors.) A detailed break down of where our money came from and where
it went to is below:

<p>
From these tables/charts you can see a few interesting things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It cost $10,785.67 to run the MusicBrainz service last year -- this includes cost for hardware and hosting.</li>
<li>PayPal donations, which represent end-user support for MusicBrainz, came to $10,345.01. The Foundation aims to have end-user donations 
pay for the actual cost of running the service, and considering that $740.00 of the direct donations can also be considered end-user
donations, the end-users did in fact pay for slightly more than what it cost to host MusicBrainz last year.</li>
<li>As it is with a lot of companies, salaries accounted for the largest slice of expenses. The Foundation paid 
$18,573.37 in salaries to Robert Kaye in the last year, which is far below a reasonable salary level for an Engineer/Executive Director
in California.  </li>
<li>$11,944.92 was earned licensing the MusicBrainz data for commercial use, which represents 28.9% of our total income.
</ul>

<p>
In an attempt to measure the overall effectiveness of the Foundation in converting donations from its users into
usable services, we would like to offer the following metrics: In 2006, the Foundation spent $10,758.67 on hosting and hardware costs
and served out 614 millon web hits and 352 millon web service hits. Calculating a cost per hit, we find that
we spent $17.56 per one millon web hits and $30.58 per one million web service hits. While these numbers may
not be significant today, we expect that these numbers will become more interesting in subsequent annual reports.


<h2>Donations </h2>

<p>
Donations per month to the Foundation were highly variable, as you can see by the chart below that shows the totals for
each month of 2006. This chart only includes donations that were less than $1000.

<p>
Larger donations such as the $15,000 Google donation are not shown in order to highlight the variability of the rate of donations. The largest
donations of 2006 (of 651 total) are shown on the right above.
Aside from cash donations and in-kind donations of server hardware a number of people made in-kind chocolate donations: A total of
18 chocolate bars were donated from 4 different countries. 
</p>

<h1>Anticipating 2007</h1>

<p>
While 2006 presented a number of interesting challenges for the MetaBrainz Foundation, a lot of progress was made in
scaling the service to handle more users and to round out the feature set of MusicBrainz. Looking forward to 2007,
the Foundation will continue to take steps torwards self sufficiency while adding one or more developers to paid staff.
MusicBrainz will continue to develop its emerging Tagger Affiliate program and work to ensure that income from tagger affiliates and 
end-users covers the rising operational costs of the project. 
</p>

<p>
The lack of active server development is the most signifcant challenge that the Foundation faces for 2007. To solve this problem
more effort needs to be expended to sell more licenses of the MusicBrainz data and to forge more relationships with 
partners that are willing to support the development of new features in MusicBrainz. The overall goal for the Foundation
in this respect is to hire at least one full time server developer in the course of the year and start working towards the
imlementation of a new database schema that drastically increases the information that MusicBrainz can collect.
</p>

<h1>Words of appreciation</h1>

<p>
The Foundation would like to thank all of its users, developers and supporters for supporting the project in 2006!
</p>
<p>
A special thanks also goes out to all the supporters behind the scenes that may not get much visibility on the
MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz sites. The Foundation would like to thank Dan Appleman, our contracts pro-bono attorney with 
<a href="http://www.hewm.com">Heller Ehrman, LLP</a>, Ed Cavazos, our intellectual propery attorney with
<a href="http://fr.com">Fish &amp; Richardson, P.C.</a>, Matthew Dunn and his excellent team at MusicIP, 
Chris DiBona of <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and Paul Lamere with <a href="http://research.sun.com">Sun Research</a>, and our
board of directors: Dan Brickley, John Buckman, Cory Doctorow, Robert Kaye and Brian Zisk.
