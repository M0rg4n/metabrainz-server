<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  The MetaBrainz Foundation will not collect any private information
  unless you choose to donate to support the MusicBrainz project.
	Any personal information you choose to provide during the donation
  process will not be revealed to anyone else. We will not contact
  you unless you give us permission to do so when you make a donation.
</p>

<h2>MetaBrainz Donors</h2>

<p>
  When you make a donation to the MetaBrainz Foundation, we are
  legally required to collect your personal information and
  keep it in our records in case we ever get audited by IRS. 
  We will not disclose your personal information to anyone else, <b>ever</b>.
</p>

<p>
  We believe in <a href="/finances">transparent finances</a>, which means 
  that we will list
  all the donations made to the foundation on this site. We will
  only list your name and the amount of the donation, unless you
  chose to be anonymous during the donation process. 
</p>

<h2>Web and FTP Access Logs (all users)</h2>

<p>
	Like just about all web sites, we keep logs of all web requests made
	against our servers.&nbsp; These logs include the usual stuff: your IP
	address, your browser's "User-Agent" string, which page you
	requested.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
	Reasonable exceptions may apply to the above policy, for example to
	comply with applicable laws.&nbsp; The MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz server
	administrators (about three people in all) can of course see any
	information on the system they want to, but to be honest we're
	probably not interested enough to look.
