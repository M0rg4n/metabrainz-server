<h2>MetaBrainz Supporters</h2>

<p>
This page lists people and companies that have helped MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz along the way. This page does
not acknowledge the people who have helped build the database (for that information, see our
<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/topmods.html">top editors page</a>) or the masses of people who
have made <a href="http://metabrainz.org/finances/hi_donors.html">small/medium monetary donations</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Many people have helped MusicBrainz in uncountable ways. Help ranges from minor support like putting up
Robert Kaye in a hotel room for a night, a posh flat for a week, a free meal here or there or a large cash
donation. There are many ways to support MusicBrainz other than giving money and this page attempts
to give thanks to those people. This list is not complete -- if you've supported MusicBrainz and would like
to be listed here, <a href="/contact">nudge us</a> please. Also, please take a look at our
<a href="/about/customers.html">customers page</a> for others who have helped MusicBrainz and 
the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainzBio">MusicBrainz Bio page</a> that lists all the 
people who make MusicBrainz happen on a day-to-day basis.
